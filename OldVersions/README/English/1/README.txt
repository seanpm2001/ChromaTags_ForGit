# ChromaTags_ForGit
Linguist color coding for Git-based programming, and much more. Inspired by [GitHub Linguist](https://github.com/github/linguist)

## Lua

Lua is used for this project, as I don't utilize it enough. It is really good for scripting in projects like this.

## Goals

ChromaTags are the names of the languages being displayed in the linguist.

There can only be 1 configuration per view (per webpage/repository) with a maximum of 6 total views. This means that there can be a linguist in up to 6 different locations at once. The following view types are available:

- Pi chart
- Tube
- Rectangle
- Squiggly tube
- Squiggly rectangle
- Bar list (each language is its own separate chart line, and can be sorted %+ to %- or %- to %+)

I am currently deciding whether 6 different configurations can be allowed at once.

## Graphics

Multiple graphics options can be applied at once. They include:

- Transparency/Opaque
- Glow
- Rainbow
- Strobing level

## Transitions:

Multiple transitions (animations) can be applied at once, but a left to right of the same type cannot be applied at the same time as a right to left of the same type.

- Fill up instantly on load (default)
- Fill up on load (left to right)
- Fill up on load (right to left)
- Fade in on load
- Electrify on load (full spectrum)
- Electrify on load (left to right)
- Electrify on load (right to left)
- Glow on load (full spectrum)
- Glow on load (left to right)
- Glow on load (right to left)

## Location:

You can duplicate the counter to any/all locations, which include:
